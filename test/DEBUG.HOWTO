How to debug individual tests with gdb:

1. echo "grassfire.get" > foobar    # feed test name into a file
2. gdb ./PluginTest
3. break main
4. run < foobar                     # read test name from a file

or preferably with a known line as follows

3. break wms/IsobandLayer.cpp:row
4. run < foobar
